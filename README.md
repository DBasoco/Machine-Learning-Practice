# Machine-Learning-Practice
An introduction into tensor operation (it's fun to play with jacobians again) and building a simple nueral network. 

This has nothing special. It will just act as a reference repository for my future projects. Has commented sections to descibe what each operation is doing. Basically it's my digital notebook for ML.
